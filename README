This file documents version 1.5.2 of the t1utils package, originally
by I. Lee Hetherington. What follows is largely his original README
from 1992.

####################################################################

t1utils is a collection of simple type-1 font manipulation programs.
Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
(binary) formats, disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
form, reassemble them into PFA or PFB format.  Additionally you can
extract font resources from a Macintosh font file (ATM/Laserwriter).

There are currently five programs:

t1ascii		converts PFB files to PFA format.

t1binary	converts PFA files to PFB format.

t1disasm	disassembles a type-1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a
		raw, human-readable text form for subsequent hand
		editing, tweaking, hint fixing, etc...

t1asm		assembles type-1 font into PFA or PFB format from 
		human-readable form produced by t1disasm.

t1unmac		extracts POST resources from a Macintosh type-1 file
		(ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use
		outside the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file
		should be stored in MacBinary format or as a raw
		resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does not have to run
		on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh type-1 fonts
		available to Unix machines and PCs.

VERSION 1.5.1 NOTES
===================

   You need an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc.

   Just type `./configure', then `make'. `make install' will build and
install the utilities and their manual pages.

   `./configure' accepts the usual options. See `INSTALL' for more
details. The most commonly used option is `--prefix', which can be used
to install the utilities in a place other than /usr/local.

   Changes to version 1.5.1 (c) 1998 Eddie Kohler, under the same
redistribution copyright as I. Lee Hetherington's.

Differences from Version 1.5
----------------------------
* t1unmac did not actually understand the -r and -b options. Fixed.

* Added better diagnostics to help you diagnose seeking problems.

Differences from Version 1.2
----------------------------
* t1asm and t1disasm understand new commands introduced by Adobe for
  the Type 2 charstring format. These commands are also used by multiple
  master fonts with intermediate masters.
    Note that t1asm and t1disasm can't actually be used on Type 2
  charstrings because of other differences (e.g., four-byte numbers are
  interpreted differently).

* t1binary will behave properly on Type 1 fonts ported from Macintosh
  PostScript files (originally a problem because of line endings).

* All programs have been massaged to take long options and to understand
  --help and --version options. The banners have been removed.
