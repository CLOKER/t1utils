Version 1.6   27.Sep.1998

* `--help' now prints to stdout, following the GNU Coding Standards.


Version 1.5.2   6.Aug.1998

* t1asm/t1disasm: Changed unknown charstring commands at the request of
  Werner Lemberg and LEE Chun-Yu. An unknown escape in the charstring, like
  12 X, is translated to "escape_X" rather than "UNKNOWN_12_X".


Version 1.5.1   31.May.1998

* t1unmac did not actually understand the -r and -b options. Fixed.

* t1unmac: Added better diagnostics to help you diagnose seeking problems.


Version 1.5   5.Mar.1998

* Initial release with Eddie Kohler as maintainer.

* All: Updated to the GNU program behavior standards (long options, --help,
  --version). Banners removed. Added more error messages.

* t1binary: Removed fixed limit on line length.

* t1binary: Supports Macintosh files, whose lines end in `\r'.

* t1binary: Supports an odd number of hex digits in a line.

* t1asm/t1disasm: Added support for Type 2 commands like `blend' and `add',
  which also appear in some multiple master fonts like Adobe Jenson.

* t1asm/t1disasm: Added support for unknown charstring commands. t1disasm
  translates an unknown command #X to "UNKNOWN_X", and t1asm does the reverse.

* t1asm/t1unmac: Changed default output to PFB.

* t1unmac: Used to be called `unpost'. `t1unmac' is a much better name.
